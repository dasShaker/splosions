"""
Watched a video on DaFluffyPotato's channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/DaFluffyPotato) that talked about how he did his
explosions.  Also watched another of his videos talking about solving problems...  So without knowing how he did it, I
tried to replicate the results.  Here is what I came up with.

I'll comment out the sound stuff.  Should work if you add your favorite boom sound effect.

SCREEN_HEIGHT = 400
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Boom")

fps = 60
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

RED = (255, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)

# Create color list and add colors to it.
color_list = [WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE]

    a list will destroy it.  'del booms_list[self]' maybe?  Need to study lists more.
    I could also add in a fiery explosion sprite at the center too...
